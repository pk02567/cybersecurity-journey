## Level 3 → 4

**Goal:** Find the password for the next level, hidden inside the `inhere` directory

**Approach:** `ls` showed nothing in `inhere` because the target file was hidden (dotfile). `ls -a` revealed a file named `...Hiding-From-You`.

**Solution:** `cat ...Hiding-From-You` printed the password directly

**Takeaway:** Hidden files (names starting with `.`) don't show under plain `ls` — `ls -a` is needed to reveal them
